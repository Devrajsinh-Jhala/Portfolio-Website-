            How this journey started ?
          </h1>
          <p>
            During my first year of college, I was introduced to front-end
            development via HTML, CSS, and JS. Then I learned about Designing,
            UI/UX, Optimizing websites, and many more domains. Since then the
            journey started, I then learned React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and
            TailwindCSS.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            This was never easy for me. One year ago, I feared when I saw any
            codebase using React or TypeScript. I dreamt of working on Next.js
            and TypeScript (literally!). Reflecting on this I am grateful that I
            didn't give up and kept learning things. Eventually, the more I
            learned, the less I felt I knew it, and thatâ€™s the best part of the
            domain it never extinguishes your learning attitude as there will
            always be a new and optimized stack coming up.
